## Pain/Health

- **Today, my pain is not the best:** I've been facing discomfort today, primarily due to my inguinal hernia and constipation caused by hydrocodone.
- **I was able to get my Xanax refilled:** After a minor scare when CVS was temporarily out of my prescription, they managed to do a partial refill for four days.
- **Urine color continues to be cloudy and yellow:** I've noticed that my urine color remains cloudy and yellow. I suspect this might be related to the antibiotics I'm taking.
- **Mentally, I feel quite good after my therapy session:** Following my therapy session, I've been in good spirits. I only had a minor issue this morning, which required me to take a Xanax. As of 13:39, I've taken only one Xanax today instead of my usual two.
- **The abscess/inflamed lymph node is the minor thing today:** Besides the soreness from the biopsy, I believe the abscess or inflamed lymph node is the least of my concerns today.
- **Most of my discomfort and pain today has been centered around the inguinal hernia:** I've been dealing with significant pain and abdominal cramping, primarily due to my inguinal hernia and constipation. Around 14:45, I had to take my second hydrocodone to manage the persisting pain in my groin, likely due to the shift from taking 5-6 pills in the hospital to the current maximum of 3 per day.

## Routine

- **To stay busy, I cleaned my fans to remove the dust:** Cleaning helped me pass the time and maintain a sense of order in my living space.
- **I cleaned up around the apartment where my pain permitted:** Cleaning always brings me happiness, and today, I pushed myself to tidy up my living space.
- **I spent about an hour researching journaling:** I dedicated some time to research journaling, furthering my knowledge and understanding of this practice.
